```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
load("ames_train.Rdata")

## Data review
First, we remove missing data from the dataset. There are this many missing values:
```{r missing, echo=FALSE}
ames_train %>% filter(complete.cases(ames_train)) %>% summarise(n())
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```
